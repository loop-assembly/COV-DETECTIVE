# Real-Time Data Visualization and Temperature Tracking with Django and Arduino: An Autonomous System with Face Detection



## Introduction

This project is an autonomous data visualizer and temperature tracker that uses an Arduino microcontroller to collect data and send it to a real-time database. The data is then displayed on a web interface created with Django. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to ensure that everyone entering public spaces is healthy and symptom-free. This project has been designed to help with this task by adding a face detection feature that ensures that users are wearing masks.
## Acknowledgements

 - Arduino board
 - Temperature sensor
 - Webcam
 - Django
 - OpenCV


## Installation
- Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Connect the temperature sensor to the Arduino board and upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board.
- Run the Django server by executing `python manage.py runserver`
- Access the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
## Usage
    1. The temperature sensor will begin collecting data as soon as the Arduino sketch is uploaded.
    2. The data will be sent to the real-time database and displayed on the web interface.
    3. The face detection feature will activate when the user accesses the web interface. If a face is detected without a mask, a warning message will be displayed.
    4. The data can be visualized using the provided graphs and charts on the web interface.



## Troubleshooting
- If the temperature data is not being displayed on the web interface, check the connection between the Arduino board and the computer.
- If the face detection feature is not working, check that the webcam is properly connected and enabled.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Arduino and Django to create an autonomous data visualization tool with real-time updates and face detection capabilities. It can be easily adapted and customized for different types of data collection and analysis. It is particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic as it can help to ensure that everyone entering public spaces is healthy and symptom-free.
