# Real-Time Data Visualization and Temperature Tracking with Django and Arduino: An Autonomous System with Face Detection



## Introduction

This project is an autonomous data visualizer and temperature tracker that uses an Arduino microcontroller to collect data and send it to a real-time database. The data is then displayed on a web interface created with Django, which also includes a face detection feature to ensure that users are wearing masks.
## Acknowledgements

 - Temperature sensor
 - Webcam
 - Django
 - OpenCV


## Installation
    1. The temperature sensor will begin collecting data as soon as the Arduino sketch is uploaded.
    2. The data will be sent to the real-time database and displayed on the web interface.
    3. The face detection feature will activate when the user accesses the web interface. If a face is detected without a mask, a warning message will be displayed.
    4. The data can be visualized using the provided graphs and charts on the web interface.



## Troubleshooting
- If the temperature data is not being displayed on the web interface, check the connection between the Arduino board and the computer.
- If the face detection feature is not working, check that the webcam is properly connected and enabled.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Arduino and Django to create an autonomous data visualization tool with real-time updates and face detection capabilities. It can be easily adapted and customized for different types of data collection and analysis.
